## Course Information

Advanced Data Management enables learners to extract and analyze raw data. Skillful data management allows organizations to discover and explore data in ways that uncover trends, issues, and their root causes. In turn, businesses are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities and more accurately plan for the future. As organizations continue to extract larger and more detailed volumes of data, the need is rapidly growing for IT professionals who possess data management skills. The skills gained in this course include performing advanced relational data modeling as well as designing data marts, lakes, and warehouses. This course will empower learners with the skills to build business logic at the database layer to employ more stability and higher data-processing speeds. Learners will gain the ability to automate common tasks to summarize and integrate data as they prepare it for analysis. Data Management - Foundations is a prerequisite for this course.

### Scenario

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached "GUI Mock-Up") and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached "UML Class Diagram"). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization's business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
