## Course Information

Advanced Data Management enables learners to extract and analyze raw data. Skillful data management allows organizations to discover and explore data in ways that uncover trends, issues, and their root causes. In turn, businesses are better equipped to capitalize on opportunities and more accurately plan for the future. As organizations continue to extract larger and more detailed volumes of data, the need is rapidly growing for IT professionals who possess data management skills. The skills gained in this course include performing advanced relational data modeling as well as designing data marts, lakes, and warehouses. This course will empower learners with the skills to build business logic at the database layer to employ more stability and higher data-processing speeds. Learners will gain the ability to automate common tasks to summarize and integrate data as they prepare it for analysis. Data Management - Foundations is a prerequisite for this course.
